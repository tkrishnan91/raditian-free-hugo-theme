Her strong sense of ownership, high level of organization, and desire to continually learn meant that she meshed seamlessly with our deeply experienced Product Marketing team and ran independently with several significant initiatives while also supporting the efforts of the larger group...she launched add-ons for our flagship product, wrote several blog posts including all the background research, and wrapped up positioning for a significant area of our product. Tara brings a hard-to-find mix of market awareness, technical knowledge, and a desire to learn along with a can-do attitude and perseverance. She's a delight to work with and would be a great addition to any team.
